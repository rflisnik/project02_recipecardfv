            Glazed donuts. Everybody loves &apos;em. Even when seemingly everyone is paleo this and gluten-free that, you
    rarely see someone refuse a glazed donut. Especially when they&apos;re homemade, hot from the oil, and taste just
    like the old-fashioned kind you remember from childhood. The donuts are less sweet
    than most, which means you can drown them in glaze and they still won&apos;t seem cloying. Talk about our kinda
    donut.

    <ol> Donuts
      <li>1. In a medium bowl, dissolve 2 tablespoons yeast in 3/4 cup warm milk. Stir in 3/4 cup of the flour to create
        a smooth paste. Cover and let rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>2. Combine the remaining warm milk and yeast in the bowl. Add the flour mixture along with the sugar, salt,
        vanilla, and egg yolks. Mix until smooth. Turn off the mixer and add 1/2 cup of the remaining flour. Mix on low
        for about 30 seconds. Add the butter and mix until it becomes incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add more flour,
        about 1/4 cup at a time. Knead until the dough pulls completely away from the sides of the bowl and is smooth
        and not too sticky. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
      </li>
      <li>3. Line a baking sheet with a lightly floured dish towel. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to
        1/2 inch thick. With a donut or cookie cutter, cut out 3-inch-diameter rounds with 1-inch-diameter holes. You
        can re-roll the scraps and cut out additional holes.</li>
      <li>4. Place the donuts at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest in
        a warm spot to proof until they almost double in size, 5 to 20 minutes, peeking every five minutes. To test
        whether the dough is ready, touch it lightly with a fingertip. If it springs back immediately, it needs more
        time. If it springs back slowly, it is ready.</li>
      <li>5. While the donuts are proofing, heat a heavy-bottomed pot with at least 2 inches of oil until a deep-fat
        thermometer registers 360˚F (182°C). With a metal spatula, carefully place a couple of doughnut holes or
        doughnuts in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until light golden
        brown. Remove and drain on a wire rack over a paper towel, and let cool slightly before glazing. Repeat with the
        remaining donuts and holes.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>Glaze
      <li>Place the sugar in a bowl and slowly stir in the milk and vanilla, if using, a little at a time, to make a
        smooth, pourable glaze.Pour the glaze into a shallow bowl. Dunk the donuts, let any excess glaze drip off, and then transfer them to
        a wire rack placed on a baking sheet or over a sheet of parchment paper to rest until glaze sets. But really,
        who are we kidding? These glazed donuts are going straight from bowl to gaping mouth.</li>
