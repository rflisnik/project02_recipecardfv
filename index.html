            Glazed donuts. Everybody loves &apos;em. Even when seemingly
            everyone is paleo this and gluten-free that, you rarely see someone
            refuse a glazed donut. Especially when they&apos;re homemade, hot
            from the oil, and taste just like the old-fashioned kind you
            remember from childhood. The donuts are less sweet than most, which
            means you can drown them in glaze and they still won&apos;t seem
            cloying. Talk about our kinda donut.

            <ol class="donuts">
              Donuts
              <li>
                Dissolve 2 tablespoons yeast in 3/4 cup warm milk. Stir in 3/4
                cup of flour to create a smooth paste. Cover and let rest in
                warm spot for 30 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Combine the remaining warm milk and yeast. Add flour mixture
                along with sugar, salt, vanilla, and egg yolks. Mix until
                smooth. Add 1/2 cup of remaining flour. Mix on low for 30
                seconds. Add butter and mix until it becomes incorporated, about
                30 seconds. Add more flour, 1/4 cup at a time. Knead until dough
                pulls completely away from sides of bowl and not too sticky.
                Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1
                hour.
              </li>
              <li>
                Line baking sheet with lightly floured dish towel. Roll out
                dough on lightly floured surface to 1/2 inch thick. With donut
                or cookie cutter, cut out 3-inch-diameter rounds with
                1-inch-diameter holes. You can re-roll scraps and cut out
                additional holes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place donuts at least 1 inch apart on baking sheet and cover
                loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest in warm spot to proof until
                they almost double in size, 5 to 20 minutes, peeking every five
                minutes. To test whether the dough is ready, touch it lightly
                with a fingertip.
              </li>
              <li>
                While donuts are proofing, heat heavy-bottomed pot with 2 inches
                of oil until thermometer registers 360˚F (182°C). With metal
                spatula, carefully place couple of doughnuts in the oil. Fry for
                1 to 2 minutes per side, until light golden brown. Remove and
                drain on wire rack over paper towel, and let cool slightly
                before glazing. Repeat with the remaining donuts and holes.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <ol class="glaze">
              Glaze
              <li>
                Place sugar in bowl and slowly stir in milk and vanilla a little
                at a time, to make a smooth, pourable glaze. Pour the glaze into
                shallow bowl. Dunk donuts, let any excess glaze drip off, and
                then transfer to wire rack placed on baking sheet or over sheet
                of parchment paper to rest until glaze sets. But really, who are
                we kidding? These glazed donuts are going straight from bowl to
                gaping mouth.
